- **Custom API service** with demo fallbacks
- **Toast notifications** for user feedback

### Key Features
- ✅ **Complete navigation flow**
- ✅ **Camera integration with permissions**
- ✅ **Duplicate detection UI**
- ✅ **Field validation system**
- ✅ **Inventory management**
- ✅ **Loading states and error handling**
- ✅ **Demo data for testing**
- ✅ **TypeScript type safety**

## 🚀 How to Run

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# Run on Android (in another terminal)
npm run android

# Run on iOS (macOS only)
npm run ios
```

### Demo Mode
The app works **immediately** with demo data:
- **Inventory**: Shows 5 sample products with low-stock alerts
- **Recent Invoices**: Shows 3 sample invoices (1 marked as duplicate)
- **Duplicate Detection**: 30% chance of showing duplicate alert
- **Validation**: Basic field validation with demo questions

## 📋 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Invoice Flow
1. Tap "Scan Invoice" → Camera opens
2. Tap capture button → Photo taken
3. Review screen shows → Fill in fields
4. Tap "Validate Fields" → Shows validation result
5. Tap "Save Invoice" → Success toast, returns to home

### Scenario 2: Duplicate Detection
1. Scan invoice → Duplicate alert appears
2. Shows similar invoice details
3. Choose "Mark as Duplicate" or "Continue Anyway"
4. Complete normal flow

### Scenario 3: Inventory Management
1. Tap "View Inventory" → See product list
2. Use search bar → Filter products
3. Pull down to refresh → Reload data
4. Notice low-stock badges on items

## 🔧 Backend Integration

The app is **ready for backend integration**:

### API Endpoints Expected
- `POST /invoices/upload` - Image upload + duplicate check
- `POST /invoices/validate` - Field validation
- `POST /invoices/save` - Save invoice + update inventory
- `GET /inventory` - Get inventory list
- `GET /invoices/recent` - Get recent invoices

### Current Behavior
- **With backend**: Uses real API calls
- **Without backend**: Falls back to demo data automatically
- **No configuration needed**: Works out of the box

## 📁 Project Structure

├── utils/             # Image utilities
└── App.tsx           # Main app with navigation
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Modern design** with clean typography
- **Consistent color scheme** (blue primary, green success, red alerts)
- **Loading indicators** for all async operations
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Responsive layout** for different screen sizes
- **Intuitive navigation** with clear visual hierarchy

## ✅ Demo Ready Checklist
